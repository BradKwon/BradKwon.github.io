I've recently started to learn Xamarin to build any mobile app with C# because I've mainly used C# for programming. 
The concept of Xamarin which is write-once, run everywhere seemed quite attractive so I decided to learn it.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What I had to do at first is to set up Xamarin development environment. 
I chose a Visual Studio 2017 community version. 
For iOS deployment, I have to use either an iMac or a Macbook. 
As I only have Windows environment, so I decided to go with android first and try out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xamarin.com/live&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Xamarin Live Player&lt;/a&gt; app for iOS deployment. 
The live player function enables developers to deploy iOS apps to their actual iPhones via the live player app.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To install the Visual Studio 2017 was easy as well as Xamarin development tools. 
I could choose whatever tools I want to install on the workload while installing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The problem was when I tried to deploy an Android project to an emulator. 
I found out that there are two types of emulators. One is using Android SDK and another is using Visual Studio Emulator for Android. 
After taking a closer look on them, I found out that Visual Studio Emulator for Android is much faster than Android SDK 
so I installed it through Visual Studio installer again. 
You can select it to install in the Individual components &amp;gt; Emulators menu.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Choose Visual Studio Emulator for Android under Emulators if it is not selected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I installed that emulator on my computer and tried to deploy again. 
But this time, I couldn’t see anything running on the emulator although everything looked fine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Everything seems fine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I googled what went wrong and finally reached this page.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My case came under both the CPU compatibility and the registry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My CPU was Intel i7-6600U and its code name is SkyLake and this CPU has an issue with Hyper-V that the Visual Studio Emulator for Android depends on. In order to sort this out, I followed this step.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Open the Hyper-V Manager and go to settings of the virtual device.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;popupImg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/tech/img/20171115/xamarin-android-emulator-setup2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hyper-V Manager main view&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Right-click on the emulator you want to set up and choose settings.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Check off “Migrate to a physical computer with a different processor version” in the Processor &amp;gt; Compatibility menu.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;popupImg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/tech/img/20171115/xamarin-android-emulator-setup3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hyper-V Manager processor compatibility configuration view&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Secondly, for the registry for Android SDK Tools path, I created a new “Android SDK Tools” key under &lt;blockquote&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\&lt;/blockquote&gt; because there wasn’t existing key like others. Then I added a string value with “Path” for name and the Android SDK full path on my computer for data. 
I could get the Android SDK full path from &lt;blockquote&gt;Visual Studio &amp;gt; Tools &amp;gt; Options &amp;gt; Xamarin &amp;gt; Android Settings &amp;gt; Android SDK Location&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;popupImg&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/tech/img/20171115/xamarin-android-emulator-setup4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Visual Studio tools options view&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Copy and paste it to the registry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eventually, I could see something different on the output window after executing debugging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;popupImg&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/tech/img/20171115/xamarin-android-emulator-setup5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Visual Studio tools options view&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Deployment Success!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2>Hello there!</h2>
<p>
    I am a software developer with curiosity about modern programming technologies.
    Therefore, my major concern nowadays is to get over the learning curve. Everyday is a series of adventures.
</p>
<p>
    I have mainly developed using .Net; however, also developed using Java-based technologies such as Spring MVC, Struts, Java web service and JSP.
    I have covered both desktop application and web development because I started my career with desktop application using Visual Basic 6 
    and have moved to web technologies.

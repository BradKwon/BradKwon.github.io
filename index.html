<h2>Hello there!</h2>
<p>
    I am the person who loves travelling, listening to music, learning and smiling.
    Get up and go attitude is what I have although, I am thoughtful. 
    I enjoy seeing that myself got more improved today than yesterday. 
    So everyday is a series of intriguing trips.
</p>
<p>
    I am an experienced software developer with the passion to learn more about modern programming technologies.
    It is fun to discover what I can do with those brilliant techies out there and become an expert of them.
    As a software developer, I believe that it is my destiny to learn new things and make them executable.

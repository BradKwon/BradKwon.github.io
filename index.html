<h2>Hello there!</h2>
<p>
    I am the person who loves travelling, music, learning and smiles.
    Get up and go attitude is what I like and it led me to come to Berlin, the heart of passion in Germany.
    I am ready to take a new adventure and will settle down here. 
</p>
<p>
    I am a software developer with curiosity about modern programming technologies.
    Therefore, my major concern nowadays is to get over the learning curve. Everyday is a series of adventures.

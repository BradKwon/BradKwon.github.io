## Hello there!

I am a software developer with the passion to learn more about modern programming technologies.
It is fun to discover what I can do with those brilliant techies out there and become an expert of them.
As a software developer, I believe that it is my destiny to learn new things and make them executable.

I am the person who loves travelling, listening to music, learning and smiling. Get up and go attitude is what I have although, I am thoughtful. I enjoy seeing that myself got more improved today than yesterday. So everyday is a series of intriguing trips.

Thank you!
